        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>This application's purpose is to store and siplay data entered by the user. The user will be able to create a
            profile and add meals to their profile. In the profile creation, users will
            provide their names and other basic information. The user will also have to fill out a form of what food
            they
            ate. There
            will be fields provided for estimated caloric amounts, dish names, and a small description of the dish. The
            user will also provide a date for this dish and a mealtime field.

        <h2>Process </h2>
        <p>As far as functionality, the page allows the user to create a profile and store it in the database. Doing
            this
            from scratch was somewhat challenging, as I often ended up referencing the previous homework for guidance. I
            was
            able to get the users object and creating a profile functional rather quickly, but the rest of the project
            provided some issues for me. The
            'Log a Meal' and 'Search for Meal' areas are not currently functioning. I spent a lot of time trying to
            figure
            out how to get the 'Log a Meal' section functional, I often mixed up my variables, causing huge problems
            later
            on in my development. I also struggled finding the solution to getting my serach area and meal logging area
            functional. I was able to gather all the provided information from the form, but I wasn't able to get it to
            update the users
            object under the 'logs' key. If given the
            opportunity, a desired function would be to calculate an estimated BMI for the user. Another one would be
            Meal
            suggestions based on diet. I would like to add as much calculated health data that is possible with the
            given
            information. </p>
